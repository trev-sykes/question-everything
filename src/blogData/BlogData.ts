What they found was no ordinary relic: the Antikythera Mechanism, a complex device of interlocking gears, is often called the world’s first analog computer. Dated to around 100 BCE, it tracked celestial movements with eerie precision. But how did an ancient civilization build something this advanced — and why does it feel like history wants us to forget it?"
