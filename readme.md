## ðŸ§© How It Works

1. **Dynamic Blog Rendering**  
   - Blog posts are stored in a TypeScript array (`blogData`), defining each postâ€™s structure and content blocks.  
   - Each block can represent text, code, quotes, or images â€” giving posts a modular composition system.  

2. **Smooth Navigation**  
   - Powered by **React Router**, enabling instant transitions between posts.  
   - Integrated with Framer Motion for **page fade-ins, slide transitions**, and interactive effects.  

3. **Reader Engagement**  
   - Uses **Giscus** for GitHub-powered comment threads â€” readers can discuss directly under posts using their GitHub accounts.  

4. **Responsive Design**  
   - Styled with **Tailwind CSS**, ensuring a fluid layout across all screen sizes.  
   - Focused on typography and spacing for long-form reading comfort.
